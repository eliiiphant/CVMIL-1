Hi! We are Team CVMIL #1, composed of Adrianne Paul Abyado, David Vincent Andal, and Seth Michael Eliserio.
This repository contains the implementation of our final project for **CS 180: Artificial Intelligence**, a course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman.

The project was developed under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Carlo Raquel and completed during the second semester of the Academic Year 2024â€“2025.
